title: Stratospheric clouds on Titan
categories: Miscellaneous

I am interested in organic and organonitrile ice clouds in Titan's stratosphere. Unlike clouds on earth, clouds on Titan are made of ices of many different compounds, including methane, ethane, benzene, cyanide, and acetonitrile. But these different species can co-condense to form an impure cloud ice particle. Mixed species ice clouds are known to form in the stratosphere on Titan, and they have implications for chemical transport and the radiative balance of the atmosphere as well as the global circulation. By cultivating a better understanding of existing observations of Titan's stratospheric ice, we may also better understand the moon's weather and climate system as a whole.
